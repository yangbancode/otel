defmodule Otel.Resource do
  @moduledoc """
  SDK Resource (`resource/sdk.md` §"SDK").

  Minikube hardcodes the resource to a fixed shape. There is no
  user config knob — `service.name` and `service.version` come
  from the standard Mix release env vars (`RELEASE_NAME`,
  `RELEASE_VSN`) at runtime, automatically set by Mix release
  boot scripts. SDK identity (`telemetry.sdk.*`,
  `deployment.environment`) is baked in at build time. Resource
  merging and Schema URL are dropped — power users go to
  `opentelemetry-erlang`. The `schema_url` field is preserved at
  the data-model level for OTLP wire compliance, but stays at
  its default `""` — there is no API to set it.

  ## Configuration

  No `config :otel, ...` knob for resource. In production with
  `mix release`, `RELEASE_NAME` and `RELEASE_VSN` are exported
  by the boot script (`bin/<app> start`) so `service.name` and
  `service.version` are populated automatically.

  Outside a release (dev `iex -S mix`, `mix test`), the env
  vars are unset and `service.name` falls back to
  `"unknown_service"`; `service.version` is the empty string
  `""`. Callers who need a specific identity in those contexts
  can export the env vars manually:

      RELEASE_NAME=my_app RELEASE_VSN=0.1.0 iex -S mix

  ## Emitted attributes

  | Attribute | Source |
  |---|---|
  | `telemetry.sdk.name` | this SDK's `:app` from `mix.exs` (compile-time) |
  | `telemetry.sdk.language` | `"elixir"` |
  | `telemetry.sdk.version` | this SDK's `:version` (compile-time) |
  | `deployment.environment` | `MIX_ENV` env var at SDK compile time (default `"dev"`) |
  | `service.name` | `RELEASE_NAME` (default `"unknown_service"`) |
  | `service.version` | `RELEASE_VSN` (default `""`) |

  Reading `RELEASE_NAME` / `RELEASE_VSN` at runtime mirrors
  `opentelemetry-erlang`'s `otel_resource_detector.erl:215-234`
  (`find_release/0`). Both env vars are exported by Mix
  release's generated boot script (`elixir/lib/mix/lib/mix/tasks/release.init.ex`
  L103-L106). Compile-time read would always see them as
  `nil` because the SDK's dep compilation phase predates any
  release boot.

  `service.version` falls back to `""` rather than being omitted
  when `RELEASE_VSN` is unset. Spec convention (Recommended,
  not Required) and `opentelemetry-erlang` would omit the key,
  but minikube prefers a single inline read here. Mimir/Prometheus
  treats `{label=""}` as equivalent to absent at query time;
  Tempo/Loki distinguish empty-string from absent — accepted
  trade-off for code simplicity.

  `deployment.environment` is captured at SDK compile time from
  `System.get_env("MIX_ENV")` directly — **not** `Mix.env/0`.
  `Mix.Tasks.Deps.Compile` wraps every dep build in
  `Mix.Dep.in_dependency` (`elixir/lib/mix/lib/mix/dep.ex`
  L246-L270) which forces `Mix.env(:prod)` for the dep's
  compilation context regardless of the consuming app's
  `MIX_ENV`, so a `Mix.env()` call inside this module would
  always evaluate to `:prod`. Reading `MIX_ENV` from the OS
  environment bypasses that override — Mix mutates only its
  internal `Mix.State` (`elixir/lib/mix/lib/mix/state.ex`
  L65-L89), never the env var.

  ## Read-time per attribute

  | Attribute | Read time | Why |
  |---|---|---|
  | `telemetry.sdk.*` | compile | dep mix.exs config only available during build |
  | `deployment.environment` | compile | `MIX_ENV` is build-time intent; release boot doesn't export it |
  | `service.name` / `service.version` | runtime | `RELEASE_NAME`/`VSN` are set by release boot script, not at build |
