defmodule Otel.Trace.SpanStorage do
  @moduledoc """
  ETS-backed storage for spans across their full lifecycle —
  both active (mutable via `set_attribute` / `add_event`) and
  completed (waiting for export after `end_span`) spans live
  in a single table.

  Each row is a 3-tuple `{span_id, %Otel.Trace.Span{}, status}`
  where `status` is `:active` or `:completed`.

  ## Public API — generic CRUD on active spans

  | Function | Role |
  |---|---|
  | `insert/1` | insert a fresh span as `:active` (back-pressure aware) |
  | `get/1` | look up an active span by `span_id` |
  | `update/1` | atomic replace of an active span (no-op if already completed) |
  | `complete/1` | atomic flip `:active → :completed` with the caller's final span value |
  | `take_completed/1` | take + delete a batch of completed spans (Exporter only) |

  Mutation flow used by `Otel.Trace.Span`:

      span = SpanStorage.get(span_id)
      new_span = apply_limits(span, ...)   # caller-side transformation
      SpanStorage.update(new_span)         # atomic replace via :ets.select_replace

  Termination flow (`end_span`):

      span = SpanStorage.get(span_id)
      ended = %{span | end_time: end_time}
      SpanStorage.complete(ended)     # atomic flip with the final span value

  ## Concurrency

  Multi-writer + single-reader (the Exporter):

  - `insert` / `get` / `update` / `complete` run on the
    caller process and write to ETS directly
    (`write_concurrency` makes this lock-free).
  - `update/1` and `complete/1` use a single atomic
    `:ets.select_replace/2` BIF whose match-spec only matches
    `:active` rows. Completed spans are never accidentally
    re-mutated.
  - `take_completed/1` is called only by `SpanExporter`
    (single reader — no take/insert races).
  - Span mutation is bound to the process that owns the span
    (the one that called `start_span`); `end_span` is the
    authoritative termination boundary — concurrent mutations
    not committed by the time `complete/1` runs are not
    preserved.

  ## Backpressure

  `insert/1` silently drops the span when the ETS table is
  already at `@max_queue_size`, matching the spec's
  `maxQueueSize` parameter for the Batching processor
  (`trace/sdk.md` L1086-L1118). Drop is a normal lifecycle
  event (per spec) rather than a failure — callers don't
  branch on the result. Subsequent `set_attribute` /
  `add_event` calls on a dropped span become no-ops because
  `update/1` matches no row.

  ## Sweep — stale active spans

  The GenServer runs a self-scheduled sweep every
  `@sweep_interval_ms` (10 minutes) that issues a single
  `:ets.select_delete/2` removing `:active` rows whose
  `start_time` is older than `@span_ttl_ns` (30 minutes).
  This is the safety net for spans that never reach
  `end_span` (process crash, dropped context, leaked
  span_ctx) — without it, stale rows would accumulate until
  the `@max_queue_size` backpressure starts dropping fresh
  spans.

  Defaults match `opentelemetry-erlang`'s `otel_span_sweeper`
  configuration. Sweep strategy is `drop` only — exporting
  fragmentary spans muddles backend data; if observability
  into sweep events is needed later, an
  `end_span`-on-sweep variant can be added.
