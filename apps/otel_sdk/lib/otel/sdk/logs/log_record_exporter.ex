defmodule Otel.SDK.Logs.LogRecordExporter do
  @moduledoc """
  Behaviour for log record exporters
  (`logs/sdk.md` §LogRecordExporter L549-L645 + §Concurrency
  requirements L647-L660).

  Exporters serialize batches of `Otel.SDK.Logs.LogRecord` to a
  protocol and transmit them to a backend. Spec L555-L557:
  *"The protocol exporter is expected to be primarily a simple
  telemetry data encoder and transmitter."*

  Spec L572-L573 — *"`Export` should not be called concurrently
  with other `Export` calls for the same exporter instance."*
  Note this is a SHOULD-strength clause (lowercase *"should
  not"* in the spec text), not a MUST. The SDK's
  `Otel.SDK.Logs.LogRecordProcessor.Simple` and
  `Otel.SDK.Logs.LogRecordProcessor.Batch` serialise export
  calls through a gen_statem so exporter implementations may
  assume single-threaded `export/2`.

  Spec L659-L660 — *"`ForceFlush` and `Shutdown` MUST be safe
  to be called concurrently."* The MUST applies independently
  of `export/2` — the two cleanup callbacks must tolerate
  concurrent invocation with each other and with anything
  else.

  ## Public API

  | Function | Role |
  |---|---|
  | `init/1` | **SDK** (SDK lifecycle) |
  | `export/2` | **SDK** (OTel API MUST) |
  | `force_flush/1` | **SDK** (OTel API MUST) |
  | `shutdown/1` | **SDK** (OTel API MUST) |

  ## Design notes

  Four deliberate divergences from
  `references/opentelemetry-erlang/apps/opentelemetry_experimental/src/otel_exporter_logs.erl`:

  1. **`force_flush/1` callback present** — erlang's
     `otel_exporter_logs.erl` exports only `init/1`, `export/3`,
     `shutdown/1`. Spec L564 lists ForceFlush in the MUST-support
     functions, so we add it here. Erlang has a spec gap; we
     follow spec.
  2. **Resource embedded in `LogRecord`** — erlang's
     `export(list(), otel_resource:t(), term())` passes Resource
     as a separate arg. Our `Otel.SDK.Logs.LogRecord` already
     carries `resource` per spec L283 (*"Resource information
     (implicitly) associated with the LogRecord"*), so passing
     it again would duplicate state. Both shapes satisfy the
     spec.
  3. **Binary `ExportResult`** — erlang returns
     `ok | success | failed_not_retryable | failed_retryable`.
     Spec L598-L608 defines `ExportResult` as binary
     Success/Failure with no retry-class signal, and spec
     L585-L590 makes retry the exporter's responsibility (the
     processor doesn't dispatch on result). We use `:ok | :error`
     to match spec semantics; richer retry classification stays
     internal to each exporter implementation.
  4. **No `:ignore` from `init/1`** — erlang's
     `otel_exporter_logs.erl` allows `init/1` to return
     `ignore`, which the owning processor maps to a
     silently-dropping no-op exporter. The OTel spec defines
     no such mechanism, and `code-conventions.md`
     §"Happy path only" rules out this kind of third-rail
     branch (neither success nor failure). Soft-disable
     belongs at the supervision/config layer — *omit the
     exporter from the processor list when disabled*, rather
     than letting the exporter return a "drop everything"
     signal at runtime. Real `init/1` failures `raise`
     instead, surfacing immediately via the supervisor.
